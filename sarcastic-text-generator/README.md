# Sarcastic (Spongebob), Funky, and Hesitation Text Generator
This silly practice project is a simple text translator that translates input text into:
* sarcastic text (also known as Spongebob text)
* funky text (a mix of super and sub script text)
* hesitation text (text with three ellipses in between)

The purpose of this project is to practice using prototype methods.
